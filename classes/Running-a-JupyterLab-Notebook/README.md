# Example Volcano Plot in a JupyterLab Notebook on [CAVATICA](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com)


## Log back in

Within your browser, navigate back to [CAVATICA](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com) and log back in.

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICALoginWindowNumber1.png">

Authorize CAVATICA to act on your behalf.
<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAGen3WindowNumber2.png">

Arrive at the CAVATICA window - we created a project and an analysis notebook already, you may have to select that project.

## Fork the GitHub Repository

We are going to fork the GitHub repository - to do so navigate in your browser to the repository for this course.

Click here [Elements of Style Workflow Creation and Maintenance](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance)

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/GitHubElementsofStyleWorkflowForkClone1.png">

In the upper righthand side of the screen, select `Fork` and choose to `Fork` it into your own personal repository.

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/GitHubElementsofStyleWorkflowForkClone2.png">

If you have already made a fork, it would make sense to fetch any upstream changes that may have occured since you last visted.  Your screen should look like this:

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/GitHubElementsofStyleWorkflowForkClone3.png">

Next, navigate to the ðŸŸ¦`Code` button on the right and select `HTTPS` and copy the link.

## Clone the repository in the Jupyterlab terminal window

Return to your CAVATICA Window and go back to your JupyterLab notebook.
And select the `terminal window`

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabNotebookLauncher.png">

Now we want to clone the repository fork we made:

At the prompt type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adeslat/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance
```

But, we might get an error.

## Authenticating for GitHub in CAVATICA

Because of that, we need to authenticate to our GitHub within CAVATICA.

We need to install `GitHub Command Line Interface` - more on this in the next lesson but for now type in the terminal window.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gh -y
```

After completing, the installation looks like this:

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabNotebookCondaInstallGH.png">

Now we need to authenticate.   We do this with our personal `GitHub Token`. 

### Generating A GitHub Authentication Token

[Generating your own GitHub Authentication Token](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/GeneratingGitHubPersonalAccessTokens.gif)

Once we have our token, we can now authenticate.

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabGHAuthLoginWithToken.png">

## Clone our repository version

Now that we are authenticated, we can clone successfully.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adeslat/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance
```

And the result should look like this:

## Useful Command Line Functions.


First we run the JupyterLab notebook which introduces us to some Command Line Functions that will be useful.

### Open the `1-using-the-command-line.ipynb`

Now follow the folder and select the first notebook in the directory, and we will execute all the command lines interactively.

Navigate to the folder on the left:

* Double click on `Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance`
* Double click on `classes`
* Double click on `Running-a-JupyterLab-Notebook`
* Finally, double click on `1-using-the-command-line.ipynb` to open the notebook

Next, clear the outputs and restart the kernel by selecting from the pull down menu under `Kernel`:

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabNotebook1-CommandLineRestartKernel.png">

Confirm your desire to restart the Kernel:

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabNotebook1-CommandLineKernelRestartConfirm.png">

And we will walk through all the selected commands.

Note that this notebook had the `python` kernel running, normally we would have executed this in a `bash` kernel.  This Kernel is not yet available on the CAVATICA platform but it has been added to the Seven Bridges Team Backlog.

### Open the `2-reading-data-and-plotting-in-R.ipynb`

Next, we will execute the second `jupyterlab` notebook, this one is running the `R` kernel.

Look again at the folders on the left and open the second notebook `2-reading-data-and-plotting-in-R.ipynb` by double-clicking on the notebook.

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabNotebook2-ReadingDataAndPlottingR.png">

Again, `Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs`.

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabNotebook2-RestartKernelAndClearOutputs.png">

Confirm your desire to do so:

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabNotebook2-RestartKernalConfirmation.png">

This is running the `R` Kernel and as we load the libraries we see that there is a `[*]` inside the brackets.   This indicates that it is executing and looks like this:

<img src="https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/assets/CAVATICAJupyterLabNotebook2-RWaitingUntilCompletion.png">

When completed, it will look the `[*]` becomes `[1]`.

## Recap

In this lesson:
* We logged into CAVATICA
* We started an interactive analysis with JupyterLab
* We authenticated with GitHub
* We executed and saw some Command Line Functions
* We generated a Volcano Plot in a JupyterLab notebook running an `R` kernel
